						"Improvisation is the key to survival in the wild. Luckily, Mavericks are experienced in their ability to use the resources around them to their advantage. They are masters of the terrains that they travel and are able to use the surrounding natural resources to create poultices with healing properties. Mavericks are also well versed in weaponry of all kinds, which makes them adaptable to a variety of combat scenarios. They have been weathered by their time in the wilderness and they are stronger for it. Mavericks are about survival, by any means necessary. Mavericks operate within three disciplines of survival: the Arcana Seeker, the Hunter, and the Wrangler.",
						"The Arcana Seeker has a working knowledge of survival as well as of the arts of magic. This makes them versatile as they have access to a number of arcane spells in addition to their survival skills. Arcana Seekers place an emphasis on intellect rather than wisdom as their arcane abilities require them to understand and memorize the complexities of spellcasting. Also within their well of knowledge is the ability to identify and understand the nuances of the nature of magic and magical devices. Some skilled Arcana Seekers even possess the ability to steal and replicate the spells of enemies used against them.",
						"The Hunter is a calculated survivalist. They meticulously plan their strategies in order to best prepare themselves for combat scenarios they are most likely to encounter. Hunters of large, individual prey may develop tactics around maximizing focused damage and avoiding the attacks of singular opponents. Hunters of smaller pacts of prey may invoke strategies that affect multiple targets at once and that allow them to escape from being surrounded. Regardless of their prey, Hunters always have a plan.",
						"The Wrangler has a connection with nature that reaches beyond that of other Mavericks. They possess a primal understanding with animals and beasts, which are bastions of nature itself. Wranglers forge personal bonds with a variety of beasts. These beasts can serve a multitude of purposes like scouts, fighters, or travelling companions. For a Wrangler, their beast companions hold as much (if not more) influence on their lives than their adventuring comrades."
