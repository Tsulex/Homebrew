						"The use of magic is a long standing tradition, though now it has become less common with fewer practitioners than ever. Along with this, magic that is not derived from divinity is seen as unholy and an affront to the divine, making many ostracize Magi and their like. The Magus is one of the distinct arcane practices to survive through the progression of society. Magi combine natural talent along with study and a keen mind in order to perform the arcane arts they have dedicated themselves to. They commit themselves to a particular style of casting and elevate spells of that style. Long live the Magi. Magi scholars fall into four distinct practices denoted by their title: the Beguiler, the Preserver, the Revoker, and the Summoner.",
						"The Beguiler’s practice focuses on the Illusion and Enchantment schools of magic. Beguilers use their magic to alter the mind and body of their targets. Their Enchantment magic serves to imbue their targets or give themselves power over the target. Their Illusion magic serves to alter their target’s perception and create false imagery to trick their targets. Skilled Beguilers will have their opponents questioning reality.",
						"The Preserver’s practice focuses on the Divination and Abjuration schools of magic. Preservers use their magic to inform and protect their allies. Their Divination magic serves to reveal useful information about their targets. Their Abjuration magic serves to protect from, block harm from, or otherwise banish the opponents of their allies. A Preserver’s goal is to support themselves and their allies by any means possible.",
						"The Revoker’s practice focuses on the Transmutation and Necromancy schools of magic. Revokers use their magic to transform and manipulate the living and the unliving. Their Transmutation magic serves to transform the physical dimensions of beings. Their Necromancy magic serves to manipulate the living and the dead and the relationship between them. Revokers are often the least respected of the Magi practices as their manipulation of life forces is often seen as heretical.",
						"The Summoner’s practice focuses on the Conjuration and Evocation schools of magic. Summoners use their magic to manipulate energies and create creatures or materials. Their Conjuration magic serves to summon creatures and lasting arcane energy; what is conjured gains benefits based on the Conjurer’s elemental affinity. Their Evocation magic serves to briefly create bursts of arcane energy in order to dispatch foes as needed. Summoners are the most combative of the Magi schools as they are unabated by the risks of combat and they possess the types of magic best suited for it."

You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation. For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it.
