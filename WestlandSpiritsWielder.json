						"Those that follow the path of the Wielder are warriors in the most traditional sense. They cling to weapons and techniques of the old way even as time marches on around them. This does not mean that you should discount them just because their way of fighting may seem outdated because a Wielder's true strength is often not as straightforward as it would seem and they can prove quite effective even on today’s battlefields. This is because, though they seem simple at first, they exhibit true skill and mastery over their chosen areas as well as a stalwart resilience that carries them through even the most adverse situations. Not only that, but the bond they form with their weapon of choice is not something you see in the warriors of today. One thing is for sure, no matter what kind of Wielder you are facing, whether it is a Brute, Knight, or a Samurai, they are sure to give a true challenge and show what battle really means. As for what battle will consist of that depends on which path the given Wielder walks.",
						"The Knight is a chosen defender, a vanguard that will protect all those that they deem worthy of being defended. They are immovable objects that will face any foe without falter and dispatch any that would become obstacles in the path that they have chosen. These warriors represent not only an unyielding defense but also respectable offense that nobody would dare scoff at for risk of wounding their pride and honor, and drawing their ire.",
						"If the Knight is the Immovable then the Brute is the unstoppable force. These warriors storm into battle with very little concern, because they know that no foe could wound them enough to keep them away from a proper battle. With mighty swings and their ability to shrug off even the hardiest of blows, the Brute will certainly show why you should fear facing them and be thankful if they are on your side. If you ever do get the chance to see a Brute in battle you will surely realize that their name comes from the true brutality they are willing to inflict in a battle.",
						"The Samurai is a mighty warrior, the same as the others, though their real power does not come from sheer strength like many wielders, but from the unnatural agility that flows through them and allows them to pull off unbelievable feats with their weaponry. In fact, the feats they perform with their weapon seem so unbelievable, others think it is just legend when they hear a samurai was able to stop bullets with their sword or even launch an attack without even touching an opponent with his weapon. A Samurai should never be underestimated, even if they are not as physically imposing as the Knight or Brute."

				"At 15th level, you can use your weapon to produce an attack that hits enemies even if they are not in melee range. As an action, you can use your melee weapon to slash in front of you dealing damage in a 15 feet cone (20 feet if your weapon has the reach property) and all creatures in that cone must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier, your choice). On a failure, they take 2d10 plus your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice) of slashing damage, half as much on a success."

				"At 20th level, you have come to understand your weapon so well you can feel its spirit. Any weapons on your person can not be broken by non-magical means, and all weapon attacks you make with weapons you are proficient with count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to non-magical attacks and damage. You can now also draw out your weapon’s spirit to aid you in combat. When you call out your weapon’s spirit, for the next 1 minute when you make a successful attack with your weapon, instead of rolling the weapon’s damage, you instead inflict the maximum amount of damage the weapon can do. You regain this feature when you finish a long rest."
