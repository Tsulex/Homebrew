						"The Warlock uses ancient arcane ability to unleash power that most mortals could only dream of having. Though they do increase their powers through hard work and discipline like others, they draw their powers from ancient, mysterious, and immensely powerful entities that have shown them favor.",
						"These powers are thrust upon some Warlocks, some bargain with their would-be patron, or a servant of them, and others work hard to garner enough favor to be gifted the power that they seek. The power of the Warlock gives those that use it choices as to the exact nature of their powers, from the spells they use, to the invocations they make, to the pact boons they receive. The pact boons Warlock receive can be the pact of the armament which gives the user a conventional weapon to match the powers received from their patrons, the pact of the chain which deems you the master over a creature that not only serves your patron but now serves under you completely, or the pact of the tome which enhances your spellcasting prowess. The final and most important choice a Warlock must make is the pact itself and which patron they will be working under, as all of them have advantages and drawbacks of some kind. Warlocks can invoke pacts with a variety of powerful entities: the Devil, the Eldritch Remnant, the Loa, or the Void.",
						"The Devil as patrons are sly by nature and will often make bargains that allow you to gain powers in return for something important. This item or aspect may draw its importance not because they want it, but because someone, perhaps even yourself, does. They require sacrifices that they know they can use later, and they frequently opt to take the long con. The deals they make ensnare many into deals that often seem too good to be true, because they are. Though you will gain great power and skill from your pact, often the price you paid will not even be remotely equivalent. Sometimes lesser servants of The Devil will form pacts themselves, but the power all derives from the same source and the outcome is always the same.",
						"The Eldritch Remnants are ancient, powerful bodies of magical energy. These cosmic fields have been left to fester for millenia. Over the course of time, they have grown to massive reserves of potential arcane energy. They have grown powerful enough to form their own consciousness and agency. Though they can not act in their own right, Eldritch Remnants impose their influence through those who have borrowed from their massive arcane reserves. Because Eldritch Remnants have no control of their own cosmic bodies, they are often very controlling of their detractors’ actions. Their goals are often fueled by their desire for a physical form. Those who have taken the Eldritch Remnant as a patron will often be given obscure tasks which seem fruitless but will build upon the work of other detractors and ultimately contribute to the Eldritch Remnant’s larger plans.",
						"The Loa exist as powerful spirits, some seeking to guide, others seeking to grant luck (good or bad), and others seeking only further their own goals. The one thing that links them together is that they are all very macabre in nature and while it might seem evil to some to them, it is just how they function and some mean no harm by it. Many Lao seek to help their followers, who revere them as gods in their own rights, though their practices may seem odd and undesirable to outsiders. Just as many Loa are extremely dark entities though pleasure themselves through death and suffering. Sometimes being able to tell the difference between which Loa is which is impossible.",
						"The least is known about The Void than any of the other patrons, which seems impossible considering the Eldritch Remnants, but at least things are sometimes comprehensible through the gibbering madness of those that chose to study them. The Void however, has few that have had any interactions with it and survived to tell the tale. Those that do survive only speak of a soul crushing black abyss that seeks to envelop all that is into itself. Though some of the Warlocks that make their pacts with the Void follow these ideals, others just thirst for powers. For some it is unknown why The Void gave them these powers, other than that the Void may be seeking to further its horrific and mysterious goals."
