						"Some people run themselves insane trying to forget their pasts. But Shamans revel in their pasts, both the past that they have experienced and the past of those that came before them. They draw their magic from the influential spirits that are tied to them. Be it their ancestors, or a creature that represents what the Shaman stands for, Shamans rely heavily on the support of the past. They have a rapport with all things living and the spirits that they represent. Shamans are able to communicate with their spiritual companions in order to harness their focus, to speak with others’ spirits (be them living, dead, or otherwise), or to relive spiritual events related to objects or locations. For Shamans, death is only a stage in the greater scheme of life. A Shaman’s spiritualism can be relative to a specific spirit or to life as a whole: these are denoted by the Animism and Totemism spiritual pathways.",
						"Animists are able to wield the dormant spiritual energies within any environment that they encounter. They are able to draw from the spiritual planes in order to fuel their spellcasting ability, though drawing these energies comes at a cost to their own spiritual stability. Animists are also able to channel the energies of the spiritual planes through them. In this channeling, they are able to emit these spiritual energies to protect themselves and their companions. Some skilled Animists are even able to temporarily enter or send others to the spiritual planes.",
						"Totemists channel the influence of specific animal spirits in order to physically represent the traits of those spirits. Those who channel the bear are given strength and are made more resilient to physical damage by their bear spirits. Those who channel the wolf are made more hearty and pact-like by their wolf spirits. Those who channel the eagle are made more swift, agile, and dexterous by their eagle spirits. While a Totemist’s spirit animal is not required to be a bear, eagle, or wolf, it should represent similar traits to one of the three."
