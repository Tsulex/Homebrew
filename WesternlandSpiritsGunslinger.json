						"Since their invention, firearms have been favored by the common folk over the bow and sword due to their relative ease of use. For most, firearms have become a tool in the kit of their everyday lives; though, Gunslingers refine the use of firearms to a near art form. Gunslingers are at the top of their class in terms of speed, accuracy, and grit. Through practice and talent, they can draw, unload, and reload their guns in the time it would take a normal individual to manage their first straight shot. Gunslingers are the masters of all types of firearms, from pistols, rifles, and shotguns, to larger weaponry like gatling guns. If it slings lead, Gunslingers do it best. A Gunslinger's style of firearms combat falls into three categories: the Sharpshooter, the Crackshot, and the Holy Gunslinger",
						"The Sharpshooter places all of their bets on accuracy, they believe that you can not kill what you can not hit.",
						"Sharpshooters put years of practice into getting their lead down-range and on target. Their focus on accuracy has not only allowed them to consistently strike their target, but to do so in such a way that it damages them gravely. The Sharpshooter’s strenuous practice has also gifted them with the ability to reload their firearms much faster than other Gunslingers. A Sharpshooter’s intended target and point of impact rarely differentiate. The Crackshot is a believer that gunslinging is more complex than the general population is led to believe. Where some are satisfied with simply “pointing and shooting,” Crackshots see potential in their weaponry. They use their firearms as tools rather than weapons, putting intent into their shots. Crackshots can use their firearms to distract, disarm, push, or otherwise impair their targets. They also wield a combative know-how, which allows them to manipulate themselves, their allies, and their opponents to their tactical advantage.",
						"The Holy Gunslinger merges gunslinging with zealotism.",
						"Their devotion to their deity has granted them access to a range of divine spells in addition to their gunslinging prowess. The Holy Gunslinger’s faith also grants them the ability to manipulate their gunslinging to fall further in line with their Zealot siblings. They are able to inscribe their rounds with divine properties and sing holy hymns in order to channel their deity’s influence on the battlefield."
