						"Zealots are servants of the divine, possessing a sense of duty to the deity that they worship. Followers, like clergies, temples, and common folk, are what gives deities their power and influence. Zealots are recipients of minute portions of their deity’s power. But unlike Warlocks, a Zealot’s power is granted through an oath of devotion to their deity, rather than an exchange. They are enforcers of their deity’s will, but still maintain the agency to make their own values and judgements. Zealots often have personal reasonings for their devotion to their deity and have their own goals which align with their deity’s values. A Zealot’s style of spellcasting and combat fall within four domains: the Combat Domain, the Life Domain, the Radiance Domain, and the Sky Domain.",
						"Zealots of the Combat Domain are champions of battle. They incorporate divine spellcasting as well as martial prowess into their fighting style. Combat Domain Zealots use their deity’s influence in order to enhance their combative ability. They have access to spells specific to their domain which serve to protect themselves and their allies as well as to destroy their enemies. Combat Domain Zealots are the soldiers of their deity and are willing to die for their cause.",
						"Zealots of the Life Domain focus more on healing than combat. Their style of spellcasting enhances their healing abilities, allowing them access to spells specific to their domain of zealotry. Life Domain Zealots also carry a warding aura which protects themselves and their allies from the damaging effects of other spells. They also possess a well of healing magic which is separate from their spells which they can mend an amount of allies within their immediate vicinity.",
						"Zealots of the Radiance Domain are a representation of all things that bring light. Their style of spellcasting incorporates fire, heat, flares, radiancy and all else that shines. Radiance Domain Zealots have access to spells specific to their domain which illuminate their enemies in order to stun and aust them. Wherever they go, they are always the brightest thing in the room, be it literally or metaphorically. Radiance Domain Zealots are mortal enemies of darkness in all aspects.",
						"Zealots of the Sky Domain are the bringers of storms. They incorporate elements such as lightning, thunder, ice, wind, and water into their spellcasting style. Sky Domain Zealots have access to spells specific to their domain which bring upon torrents of the sky. They are able to channel these elements into their attacks and spells in order to maximize their impact. Storms bring comfort rather than fear to Sky Domain Zealots."
