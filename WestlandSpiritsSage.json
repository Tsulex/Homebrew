						"Few have the vigor to ask the hard questions in life. For the majority, the most simple answers to the questions that they face are often satisfactory enough. Sages dig deeper, they wish to know the bigger picture. They are ever skeptical and are always in search of a better, truer answer. Sages focus on their own personal school of thought and find ways in which they can alter it with their own ideas. They also share their ideas with their comrades, arousing their mind and allowing them to hone their focus. Sages combine their understanding of reality and magic in order to cast and elevate spells based on their philosophical insight. Sages fall within four distinct schools of philosophy: the School of Arts, the School of Combat, the School of Duality, and the School of Thought.",
						"Sages that fall within the School of Arts place value in the importance of expression. While most Scholars of Art choose to express through music, it is not the only form of expression. Expression can come through all forms of art, such as visual arts like paintings or dancing, auditory arts like music or poems, or sensory arts like cooking or candles. Regardless of the medium, a Scholar of Art’s expressions bolster their allies and hinder their foes.",
						"Sages that fall within the School of Combat treat battle as a field of study rather than a brackish melee. They are able to weave their insights and inspirations in the midst of combat. Scholars of Combat are also trained in armor and weaponry and are eager to join their companions into the fray. They are able to use their combative inspiration to focus their allies and allow them to go beyond their normal limits. No fighter has ever leaped into battle with a Scholar of Combat at their side and been worse for it.",
						"Sages that fall within the School of Duality believe that the synchronization of mind and body is essential. To be of both sound mind and sound body takes years of study and meditation. Scholars of Duality find themselves able to enhance their arcane arts through the alignment of their body and mind. Their binary ideologies also influence the spell that they cast, often including aspects of duality. Parts of reality which have duality, such as night and day or life and death, are seen as near-divine through the eyes of the Scholar of Duality. Sages that fall within the School of Thought are the truest of intellectuals. They emphasize the necessity of being wise as well as being knowledgeable. Scholars of Thought are consistently in the process of acquiring new information, seeing life as a constant cycle of learning. They develop critical thinking and logic skills which allow them to pursue knowledge through both wisdom and intelligence. Scholars of Thought are also able to allow both their wisdom and intelligence to influence their spellcasting."
