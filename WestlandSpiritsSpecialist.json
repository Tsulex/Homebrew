						"Specialists combine their knowledge of a modern battlefield and their excellent agility to blow away their enemies, literally. Specialists are able to craft specialized bombs that have a form and function that start out similar to grenades but evolve as they craft them further. They use these bombs to demolish any obstacles that would get in their way, often without worry as to their own wellbeing due to the safety mechanisms built into the bomb. Specialists are also highly adaptable and are usually smart enough to know when to blow things up and when to ask questions.",
						"Some skilled specialists have even found a way to quiet the weapons of the modern battlefield, building things to bring a stealthier component to the loud firearms that define current combat. Specialists have found a way to explode onto the battlefield in other ways too, especially by using the tools in their area of expertise. Specialists have three areas of expertise that they can fit into: the Alchemist, the Demolitionist, and the Mechanist, all of them serve to hone the skills of the Specialists who go down them in one way or another. Alchemists are skilled in the art of not only creating concoctions with various effects, but also reproducing magical spells in their own way. The potions that an alchemist creates can be imbued with the magic of a spell that can aid themselves or an ally. They are also able to create health potions so that themself and their allies can stay fresh during and after battles. Though only one potion can be active at a time for a normal alchemist, they prove to a great boon in times of need. Alchemists have also learned how to effectively use poisons and acids in order to be leave their opponents cowering in fear, which they eventually build up a resistance to themselves.",
						"Demolitionists are often the type of Specialists that would rather blow things up first and ask questions later, despite what their better sense would tell them to do. These Specialists focus on making their bombs not only much stronger but also more adaptable and will even remove safety features from bombs so that they can blow up when certain special conditions are met, even if they are not present. Demolitionists will use whatever they can to blow up, set fire to, and overall just completely ruin and demolish whatever would stand in their way.",
						"If Specialists are masters of the modern battlefield, Mechanists seek to be those of the future battlefield. Mechanists wish to understand and advance technology beyond how it currently exists, including the technology used in battle. Every Mechanist has an impressive knowledge of mechanics and will often spend most of their free time tinkering with something. This almost always leads to a further understanding of energy, especially electricity, and to what kind of weapons could be built out of what they are learning. Often Mechanists keep their new super weapons a secret unless you are either close to them or they plan to use it on you, but those that witness them equate them to things that skilled practitioners of magic can do."
