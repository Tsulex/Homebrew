						"A warrior’s relationship with their weapon is often the determinant of life and death during the heat of combat.",
						"Those who do not know the capabilities of themselves and their weapons tend to live shorter lives. Brawlers bypass this relationship entirely, becoming weapons themselves.",
						"Through experience and training, Brawlers fight with the weapons they were born with, their hands and feet. Those that do use weapons view them as extensions of themselves, rather than separate entities. Brawlers are fast on their feet and often have no problem closing the distance between themselves and their targets. In worlds where the distance of combatants is growing, Brawlers thrive in being up-close and personal. A Brawler’s fighting style falls in one of three distinct practices: the Monk, the Pugilist, and the Ravager.",
						"The Monk is a trained practitioner of martial arts. They often have a master from which they learn precise techniques which allow them to access a well of potential energy within themselves known as Ki. Monks are also trained to incorporate traditional weapons of their practice into their fighting style. Most Monks need to train for years before being able to find and access their Ki. They use this well of energy to enhance their agility, reflexes, and destructive potential.",
						"The Pugilist shows similarities to the Monk in that they are trained in their fighting style often by a master (or rather, a coach). But rather than being trained through discipline and monotonous practice, Pugilists are trained through experience. Their coach will often match them with other Pugilists by which to be beaten, treating the defeat as an opportunity to improve. They analyze their opponents in search of weaknesses in their form that they could exploit. Pugilists choose when and where to strike discriminately in order to give themselves the competitive advantage.",
						"The Ravager differs greatly from the Monk and the Pugilist in that in most cases they are entirely untrained and have merely developed their fighting style through real-world experience. They have a well of combative Fury which can stem from a multitude of things like an energized love for combat or anger management issues. When Ravagers embrace their Fury, they temporarily enter a trance of increased strength and ferality. In this trance they are able to accomplish feats of strength that they would normally be unable to, but they are also more impulsive and less conscious of their actions. The Ravager’s practical experience has also allowed them to improvise and use objects in their environment as tentative weapons."

						"Since their invention, firearms have been favored by the common folk over the bow and sword due to their relative ease of use. For most, firearms have become a tool in the kit of their everyday lives; though, Gunslingers refine the use of firearms to a near art form. Gunslingers are at the top of their class in terms of speed, accuracy, and grit. Through practice and talent, they can draw, unload, and reload their guns in the time it would take a normal individual to manage their first straight shot. Gunslingers are the masters of all types of firearms, from pistols, rifles, and shotguns, to larger weaponry like gatling guns. If it slings lead, Gunslingers do it best. A Gunslinger's style of firearms combat falls into three categories: the Sharpshooter, the Crackshot, and the Holy Gunslinger",
						"The Sharpshooter places all of their bets on accuracy, they believe that you can not kill what you can not hit.",
						"Sharpshooters put years of practice into getting their lead down-range and on target. Their focus on accuracy has not only allowed them to consistently strike their target, but to do so in such a way that it damages them gravely. The Sharpshooter’s strenuous practice has also gifted them with the ability to reload their firearms much faster than other Gunslingers. A Sharpshooter’s intended target and point of impact rarely differentiate. The Crackshot is a believer that gunslinging is more complex than the general population is led to believe. Where some are satisfied with simply “pointing and shooting,” Crackshots see potential in their weaponry. They use their firearms as tools rather than weapons, putting intent into their shots. Crackshots can use their firearms to distract, disarm, push, or otherwise impair their targets. They also wield a combative know-how, which allows them to manipulate themselves, their allies, and their opponents to their tactical advantage.",
						"The Holy Gunslinger merges gunslinging with zealotism.",
						"Their devotion to their deity has granted them access to a range of divine spells in addition to their gunslinging prowess. The Holy Gunslinger’s faith also grants them the ability to manipulate their gunslinging to fall further in line with their Zealot siblings. They are able to inscribe their rounds with divine properties and sing holy hymns in order to channel their deity’s influence on the battlefield."

						"The use of magic is a long standing tradition, though now it has become less common with fewer practitioners than ever. Along with this, magic that is not derived from divinity is seen as unholy and an affront to the divine, making many ostracize Magi and their like. The Magus is one of the distinct arcane practices to survive through the progression of society. Magi combine natural talent along with study and a keen mind in order to perform the arcane arts they have dedicated themselves to. They commit themselves to a particular style of casting and elevate spells of that style. Long live the Magi. Magi scholars fall into four distinct practices denoted by their title: the Beguiler, the Preserver, the Revoker, and the Summoner.",
						"The Beguiler’s practice focuses on the Illusion and Enchantment schools of magic. Beguilers use their magic to alter the mind and body of their targets. Their Enchantment magic serves to imbue their targets or give themselves power over the target. Their Illusion magic serves to alter their target’s perception and create false imagery to trick their targets. Skilled Beguilers will have their opponents questioning reality.",
						"The Preserver’s practice focuses on the Divination and Abjuration schools of magic. Preservers use their magic to inform and protect their allies. Their Divination magic serves to reveal useful information about their targets. Their Abjuration magic serves to protect from, block harm from, or otherwise banish the opponents of their allies. A Preserver’s goal is to support themselves and their allies by any means possible.",
						"The Revoker’s practice focuses on the Transmutation and Necromancy schools of magic. Revokers use their magic to transform and manipulate the living and the unliving. Their Transmutation magic serves to transform the physical dimensions of beings. Their Necromancy magic serves to manipulate the living and the dead and the relationship between them. Revokers are often the least respected of the Magi practices as their manipulation of life forces is often seen as heretical.",
						"The Summoner’s practice focuses on the Conjuration and Evocation schools of magic. Summoners use their magic to manipulate energies and create creatures or materials. Their Conjuration magic serves to summon creatures and lasting arcane energy; what is conjured gains benefits based on the Conjurer’s elemental affinity. Their Evocation magic serves to briefly create bursts of arcane energy in order to dispatch foes as needed. Summoners are the most combative of the Magi schools as they are unabated by the risks of combat and they possess the types of magic best suited for it."

						"Improvisation is the key to survival in the wild. Luckily, Mavericks are experienced in their ability to use the resources around them to their advantage. They are masters of the terrains that they travel and are able to use the surrounding natural resources to create poultices with healing properties. Mavericks are also well versed in weaponry of all kinds, which makes them adaptable to a variety of combat scenarios. They have been weathered by their time in the wilderness and they are stronger for it. Mavericks are about survival, by any means necessary. Mavericks operate within three disciplines of survival: the Arcana Seeker, the Hunter, and the Wrangler.",
						"The Arcana Seeker has a working knowledge of survival as well as of the arts of magic. This makes them versatile as they have access to a number of arcane spells in addition to their survival skills. Arcana Seekers place an emphasis on intellect rather than wisdom as their arcane abilities require them to understand and memorize the complexities of spellcasting. Also within their well of knowledge is the ability to identify and understand the nuances of the nature of magic and magical devices. Some skilled Arcana Seekers even possess the ability to steal and replicate the spells of enemies used against them.",
						"The Hunter is a calculated survivalist. They meticulously plan their strategies in order to best prepare themselves for combat scenarios they are most likely to encounter. Hunters of large, individual prey may develop tactics around maximizing focused damage and avoiding the attacks of singular opponents. Hunters of smaller pacts of prey may invoke strategies that affect multiple targets at once and that allow them to escape from being surrounded. Regardless of their prey, Hunters always have a plan.",
						"The Wrangler has a connection with nature that reaches beyond that of other Mavericks. They possess a primal understanding with animals and beasts, which are bastions of nature itself. Wranglers forge personal bonds with a variety of beasts. These beasts can serve a multitude of purposes like scouts, fighters, or travelling companions. For a Wrangler, their beast companions hold as much (if not more) influence on their lives than their adventuring comrades."

						"Information is valuable, especially in combat. Outlaws specialize in collecting as much information about their opponents as they can while revealing as little information about themselves as possible. They analyze their targets, looking for weaknesses that they could exploit. Outlaws find the metaphorical (sometimes literal) cracks in the armor of the problems they face and dig their knives deep into them. They also deceive and vanish from their opponents, keeping their true intentions hidden. Outlaws thrive in the dichotomy of being unknown to their foes while simultaneously knowing everything about them. An Outlaw’s area of expertise falls into three categories: the Bandito, the Cutthroat, the Desperado, and the Knifeslinger.",
						"The Bandito dedicates themself to being as dexterous as possible, in all aspects. For them, it is as if time worked a little slower. Banditos make quick work of intricate tasks that would take much longer for ordinary people, like picking locks, scaling buildings, or shuffling cards. A Bandito’s hands are as swift as they are deliberate. Banditos also possess the ability to separate themselves from their work, they could take a bounty on their mother and chalk it up to being “just business.”",
						"The Cutthroat is a professional and a provider of services. They treat bounties and the like as jobs, and they have the right tools for it. Cutthroats are not only precise about killing, but also every step that leads up to it. From infiltration, to disguise, to getting the jump on their target. Cutthroats do it all (and without suspicion if they are skilled enough). Because bounty hunting is their profession, Cutthroats conduct their business as such. They will not “kill some yellow-belly who stole my money!” but they will happily eliminate a party guilty of petty theft, for the right price of course.",
						"The Desperado strikes a balance between risk and reward. For them, good fortune comes when they need it and the risk is very well worth the potential blunders afterward. Desperados are able to succeed in even the most unlikely of circumstances, using their wit to decipher the best moment to push their luck. They are also well versed in the dimensions of firearms, and through their understanding, are able to load and smuggle them with ease. Desperados favor the pistol, and are able to use them to exploit their opponents in a similar fashion to their other Outlaw siblings.",
						"The Knifeslinger is the most specialized of the Outlaw focuses. They do one thing and they do it very well, sling knives. Be it at a range or up close, Knifeslingers are at their most natural with daggers in their hands. They are equally confident in throwing their daggers as they are in slashing with them. The motions and techniques of close-quarters, personal combat are second-nature to the Knifeslinger. Their familiarity with dynamics of combat allows them to react faster and grants them the ability to instill panic into their enemies."

						"Few have the vigor to ask the hard questions in life. For the majority, the most simple answers to the questions that they face are often satisfactory enough. Sages dig deeper, they wish to know the bigger picture. They are ever skeptical and are always in search of a better, truer answer. Sages focus on their own personal school of thought and find ways in which they can alter it with their own ideas. They also share their ideas with their comrades, arousing their mind and allowing them to hone their focus. Sages combine their understanding of reality and magic in order to cast and elevate spells based on their philosophical insight. Sages fall within four distinct schools of philosophy: the School of Arts, the School of Combat, the School of Duality, and the School of Thought.",
						"Sages that fall within the School of Arts place value in the importance of expression. While most Scholars of Art choose to express through music, it is not the only form of expression. Expression can come through all forms of art, such as visual arts like paintings or dancing, auditory arts like music or poems, or sensory arts like cooking or candles. Regardless of the medium, a Scholar of Art’s expressions bolster their allies and hinder their foes.",
						"Sages that fall within the School of Combat treat battle as a field of study rather than a brackish melee. They are able to weave their insights and inspirations in the midst of combat. Scholars of Combat are also trained in armor and weaponry and are eager to join their companions into the fray. They are able to use their combative inspiration to focus their allies and allow them to go beyond their normal limits. No fighter has ever leaped into battle with a Scholar of Combat at their side and been worse for it.",
						"Sages that fall within the School of Duality believe that the synchronization of mind and body is essential. To be of both sound mind and sound body takes years of study and meditation. Scholars of Duality find themselves able to enhance their arcane arts through the alignment of their body and mind. Their binary ideologies also influence the spell that they cast, often including aspects of duality. Parts of reality which have duality, such as night and day or life and death, are seen as near-divine through the eyes of the Scholar of Duality. Sages that fall within the School of Thought are the truest of intellectuals. They emphasize the necessity of being wise as well as being knowledgeable. Scholars of Thought are consistently in the process of acquiring new information, seeing life as a constant cycle of learning. They develop critical thinking and logic skills which allow them to pursue knowledge through both wisdom and intelligence. Scholars of Thought are also able to allow both their wisdom and intelligence to influence their spellcasting."

						"Some people run themselves insane trying to forget their pasts. But Shamans revel in their pasts, both the past that they have experienced and the past of those that came before them. They draw their magic from the influential spirits that are tied to them. Be it their ancestors, or a creature that represents what the Shaman stands for, Shamans rely heavily on the support of the past. They have a rapport with all things living and the spirits that they represent. Shamans are able to communicate with their spiritual companions in order to harness their focus, to speak with others’ spirits (be them living, dead, or otherwise), or to relive spiritual events related to objects or locations. For Shamans, death is only a stage in the greater scheme of life. A Shaman’s spiritualism can be relative to a specific spirit or to life as a whole: these are denoted by the Animism and Totemism spiritual pathways.",
						"Animists are able to wield the dormant spiritual energies within any environment that they encounter. They are able to draw from the spiritual planes in order to fuel their spellcasting ability, though drawing these energies comes at a cost to their own spiritual stability. Animists are also able to channel the energies of the spiritual planes through them. In this channeling, they are able to emit these spiritual energies to protect themselves and their companions. Some skilled Animists are even able to temporarily enter or send others to the spiritual planes.",
						"Totemists channel the influence of specific animal spirits in order to physically represent the traits of those spirits. Those who channel the bear are given strength and are made more resilient to physical damage by their bear spirits. Those who channel the wolf are made more hearty and pact-like by their wolf spirits. Those who channel the eagle are made more swift, agile, and dexterous by their eagle spirits. While a Totemist’s spirit animal is not required to be a bear, eagle, or wolf, it should represent similar traits to one of the three."

						"Specialists combine their knowledge of a modern battlefield and their excellent agility to blow away their enemies, literally. Specialists are able to craft specialized bombs that have a form and function that start out similar to grenades but evolve as they craft them further. They use these bombs to demolish any obstacles that would get in their way, often without worry as to their own wellbeing due to the safety mechanisms built into the bomb. Specialists are also highly adaptable and are usually smart enough to know when to blow things up and when to ask questions.",
						"Some skilled specialists have even found a way to quiet the weapons of the modern battlefield, building things to bring a stealthier component to the loud firearms that define current combat. Specialists have found a way to explode onto the battlefield in other ways too, especially by using the tools in their area of expertise. Specialists have three areas of expertise that they can fit into: the Alchemist, the Demolitionist, and the Mechanist, all of them serve to hone the skills of the Specialists who go down them in one way or another. Alchemists are skilled in the art of not only creating concoctions with various effects, but also reproducing magical spells in their own way. The potions that an alchemist creates can be imbued with the magic of a spell that can aid themselves or an ally. They are also able to create health potions so that themself and their allies can stay fresh during and after battles. Though only one potion can be active at a time for a normal alchemist, they prove to a great boon in times of need. Alchemists have also learned how to effectively use poisons and acids in order to be leave their opponents cowering in fear, which they eventually build up a resistance to themselves.",
						"Demolitionists are often the type of Specialists that would rather blow things up first and ask questions later, despite what their better sense would tell them to do. These Specialists focus on making their bombs not only much stronger but also more adaptable and will even remove safety features from bombs so that they can blow up when certain special conditions are met, even if they are not present. Demolitionists will use whatever they can to blow up, set fire to, and overall just completely ruin and demolish whatever would stand in their way.",
						"If Specialists are masters of the modern battlefield, Mechanists seek to be those of the future battlefield. Mechanists wish to understand and advance technology beyond how it currently exists, including the technology used in battle. Every Mechanist has an impressive knowledge of mechanics and will often spend most of their free time tinkering with something. This almost always leads to a further understanding of energy, especially electricity, and to what kind of weapons could be built out of what they are learning. Often Mechanists keep their new super weapons a secret unless you are either close to them or they plan to use it on you, but those that witness them equate them to things that skilled practitioners of magic can do."

						"The Warlock uses ancient arcane ability to unleash power that most mortals could only dream of having. Though they do increase their powers through hard work and discipline like others, they draw their powers from ancient, mysterious, and immensely powerful entities that have shown them favor.",
						"These powers are thrust upon some Warlocks, some bargain with their would-be patron, or a servant of them, and others work hard to garner enough favor to be gifted the power that they seek. The power of the Warlock gives those that use it choices as to the exact nature of their powers, from the spells they use, to the invocations they make, to the pact boons they receive. The pact boons Warlock receive can be the pact of the armament which gives the user a conventional weapon to match the powers received from their patrons, the pact of the chain which deems you the master over a creature that not only serves your patron but now serves under you completely, or the pact of the tome which enhances your spellcasting prowess. The final and most important choice a Warlock must make is the pact itself and which patron they will be working under, as all of them have advantages and drawbacks of some kind. Warlocks can invoke pacts with a variety of powerful entities: the Devil, the Eldritch Remnant, the Loa, or the Void.",
						"The Devil as patrons are sly by nature and will often make bargains that allow you to gain powers in return for something important. This item or aspect may draw its importance not because they want it, but because someone, perhaps even yourself, does. They require sacrifices that they know they can use later, and they frequently opt to take the long con. The deals they make ensnare many into deals that often seem too good to be true, because they are. Though you will gain great power and skill from your pact, often the price you paid will not even be remotely equivalent. Sometimes lesser servants of The Devil will form pacts themselves, but the power all derives from the same source and the outcome is always the same.",
						"The Eldritch Remnants are ancient, powerful bodies of magical energy. These cosmic fields have been left to fester for millenia. Over the course of time, they have grown to massive reserves of potential arcane energy. They have grown powerful enough to form their own consciousness and agency. Though they can not act in their own right, Eldritch Remnants impose their influence through those who have borrowed from their massive arcane reserves. Because Eldritch Remnants have no control of their own cosmic bodies, they are often very controlling of their detractors’ actions. Their goals are often fueled by their desire for a physical form. Those who have taken the Eldritch Remnant as a patron will often be given obscure tasks which seem fruitless but will build upon the work of other detractors and ultimately contribute to the Eldritch Remnant’s larger plans.",
						"The Loa exist as powerful spirits, some seeking to guide, others seeking to grant luck (good or bad), and others seeking only further their own goals. The one thing that links them together is that they are all very macabre in nature and while it might seem evil to some to them, it is just how they function and some mean no harm by it. Many Lao seek to help their followers, who revere them as gods in their own rights, though their practices may seem odd and undesirable to outsiders. Just as many Loa are extremely dark entities though pleasure themselves through death and suffering. Sometimes being able to tell the difference between which Loa is which is impossible.",
						"The least is known about The Void than any of the other patrons, which seems impossible considering the Eldritch Remnants, but at least things are sometimes comprehensible through the gibbering madness of those that chose to study them. The Void however, has few that have had any interactions with it and survived to tell the tale. Those that do survive only speak of a soul crushing black abyss that seeks to envelop all that is into itself. Though some of the Warlocks that make their pacts with the Void follow these ideals, others just thirst for powers. For some it is unknown why The Void gave them these powers, other than that the Void may be seeking to further its horrific and mysterious goals."

						"Those that follow the path of the Wielder are warriors in the most traditional sense. They cling to weapons and techniques of the old way even as time marches on around them. This does not mean that you should discount them just because their way of fighting may seem outdated because a Wielder's true strength is often not as straightforward as it would seem and they can prove quite effective even on today’s battlefields. This is because, though they seem simple at first, they exhibit true skill and mastery over their chosen areas as well as a stalwart resilience that carries them through even the most adverse situations. Not only that, but the bond they form with their weapon of choice is not something you see in the warriors of today. One thing is for sure, no matter what kind of Wielder you are facing, whether it is a Brute, Knight, or a Samurai, they are sure to give a true challenge and show what battle really means. As for what battle will consist of that depends on which path the given Wielder walks.",
						"The Knight is a chosen defender, a vanguard that will protect all those that they deem worthy of being defended. They are immovable objects that will face any foe without falter and dispatch any that would become obstacles in the path that they have chosen. These warriors represent not only an unyielding defense but also respectable offense that nobody would dare scoff at for risk of wounding their pride and honor, and drawing their ire.",
						"If the Knight is the Immovable then the Brute is the unstoppable force. These warriors storm into battle with very little concern, because they know that no foe could wound them enough to keep them away from a proper battle. With mighty swings and their ability to shrug off even the hardiest of blows, the Brute will certainly show why you should fear facing them and be thankful if they are on your side. If you ever do get the chance to see a Brute in battle you will surely realize that their name comes from the true brutality they are willing to inflict in a battle.",
						"The Samurai is a mighty warrior, the same as the others, though their real power does not come from sheer strength like many wielders, but from the unnatural agility that flows through them and allows them to pull off unbelievable feats with their weaponry. In fact, the feats they perform with their weapon seem so unbelievable, others think it is just legend when they hear a samurai was able to stop bullets with their sword or even launch an attack without even touching an opponent with his weapon. A Samurai should never be underestimated, even if they are not as physically imposing as the Knight or Brute."

						"Zealots are servants of the divine, possessing a sense of duty to the deity that they worship. Followers, like clergies, temples, and common folk, are what gives deities their power and influence. Zealots are recipients of minute portions of their deity’s power. But unlike Warlocks, a Zealot’s power is granted through an oath of devotion to their deity, rather than an exchange. They are enforcers of their deity’s will, but still maintain the agency to make their own values and judgements. Zealots often have personal reasonings for their devotion to their deity and have their own goals which align with their deity’s values. A Zealot’s style of spellcasting and combat fall within four domains: the Combat Domain, the Life Domain, the Radiance Domain, and the Sky Domain.",
						"Zealots of the Combat Domain are champions of battle. They incorporate divine spellcasting as well as martial prowess into their fighting style. Combat Domain Zealots use their deity’s influence in order to enhance their combative ability. They have access to spells specific to their domain which serve to protect themselves and their allies as well as to destroy their enemies. Combat Domain Zealots are the soldiers of their deity and are willing to die for their cause.",
						"Zealots of the Life Domain focus more on healing than combat. Their style of spellcasting enhances their healing abilities, allowing them access to spells specific to their domain of zealotry. Life Domain Zealots also carry a warding aura which protects themselves and their allies from the damaging effects of other spells. They also possess a well of healing magic which is separate from their spells which they can mend an amount of allies within their immediate vicinity.",
						"Zealots of the Radiance Domain are a representation of all things that bring light. Their style of spellcasting incorporates fire, heat, flares, radiancy and all else that shines. Radiance Domain Zealots have access to spells specific to their domain which illuminate their enemies in order to stun and aust them. Wherever they go, they are always the brightest thing in the room, be it literally or metaphorically. Radiance Domain Zealots are mortal enemies of darkness in all aspects.",
						"Zealots of the Sky Domain are the bringers of storms. They incorporate elements such as lightning, thunder, ice, wind, and water into their spellcasting style. Sky Domain Zealots have access to spells specific to their domain which bring upon torrents of the sky. They are able to channel these elements into their attacks and spells in order to maximize their impact. Storms bring comfort rather than fear to Sky Domain Zealots."

But as humans evolved from living in caves, they began to doubt the divinity of these giant serpents. As such, humans moved beyond the lands in which these Couatl inhabited and formed their own religions. The Couatl were left without followers to serve them. Eventually, they grew desperate enough to start experimenting with their own eggs. Through the innate arcane adaptivity granted by their celestial ancestry, the Couatl manipulated their eggs into producing smaller, more human-like, versions of themselves. After more experimenting, the Couatl were able to produce these Couatlborn in such a way that they were able to reproduce themselves and no longer had to be birthed from the Couatl's own eggs."
