						"A warrior’s relationship with their weapon is often the determinant of life and death during the heat of combat.",
						"Those who do not know the capabilities of themselves and their weapons tend to live shorter lives. Brawlers bypass this relationship entirely, becoming weapons themselves.",
						"Through experience and training, Brawlers fight with the weapons they were born with, their hands and feet. Those that do use weapons view them as extensions of themselves, rather than separate entities. Brawlers are fast on their feet and often have no problem closing the distance between themselves and their targets. In worlds where the distance of combatants is growing, Brawlers thrive in being up-close and personal. A Brawler’s fighting style falls in one of three distinct practices: the Monk, the Pugilist, and the Ravager.",
						"The Monk is a trained practitioner of martial arts. They often have a master from which they learn precise techniques which allow them to access a well of potential energy within themselves known as Ki. Monks are also trained to incorporate traditional weapons of their practice into their fighting style. Most Monks need to train for years before being able to find and access their Ki. They use this well of energy to enhance their agility, reflexes, and destructive potential.",
						"The Pugilist shows similarities to the Monk in that they are trained in their fighting style often by a master (or rather, a coach). But rather than being trained through discipline and monotonous practice, Pugilists are trained through experience. Their coach will often match them with other Pugilists by which to be beaten, treating the defeat as an opportunity to improve. They analyze their opponents in search of weaknesses in their form that they could exploit. Pugilists choose when and where to strike discriminately in order to give themselves the competitive advantage.",
						"The Ravager differs greatly from the Monk and the Pugilist in that in most cases they are entirely untrained and have merely developed their fighting style through real-world experience. They have a well of combative Fury which can stem from a multitude of things like an energized love for combat or anger management issues. When Ravagers embrace their Fury, they temporarily enter a trance of increased strength and ferality. In this trance they are able to accomplish feats of strength that they would normally be unable to, but they are also more impulsive and less conscious of their actions. The Ravager’s practical experience has also allowed them to improvise and use objects in their environment as tentative weapons."
