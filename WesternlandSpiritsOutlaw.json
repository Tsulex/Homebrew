						"Information is valuable, especially in combat. Outlaws specialize in collecting as much information about their opponents as they can while revealing as little information about themselves as possible. They analyze their targets, looking for weaknesses that they could exploit. Outlaws find the metaphorical (sometimes literal) cracks in the armor of the problems they face and dig their knives deep into them. They also deceive and vanish from their opponents, keeping their true intentions hidden. Outlaws thrive in the dichotomy of being unknown to their foes while simultaneously knowing everything about them. An Outlaw’s area of expertise falls into three categories: the Bandito, the Cutthroat, the Desperado, and the Knifeslinger.",
						"The Bandito dedicates themself to being as dexterous as possible, in all aspects. For them, it is as if time worked a little slower. Banditos make quick work of intricate tasks that would take much longer for ordinary people, like picking locks, scaling buildings, or shuffling cards. A Bandito’s hands are as swift as they are deliberate. Banditos also possess the ability to separate themselves from their work, they could take a bounty on their mother and chalk it up to being “just business.”",
						"The Cutthroat is a professional and a provider of services. They treat bounties and the like as jobs, and they have the right tools for it. Cutthroats are not only precise about killing, but also every step that leads up to it. From infiltration, to disguise, to getting the jump on their target. Cutthroats do it all (and without suspicion if they are skilled enough). Because bounty hunting is their profession, Cutthroats conduct their business as such. They will not “kill some yellow-belly who stole my money!” but they will happily eliminate a party guilty of petty theft, for the right price of course.",
						"The Desperado strikes a balance between risk and reward. For them, good fortune comes when they need it and the risk is very well worth the potential blunders afterward. Desperados are able to succeed in even the most unlikely of circumstances, using their wit to decipher the best moment to push their luck. They are also well versed in the dimensions of firearms, and through their understanding, are able to load and smuggle them with ease. Desperados favor the pistol, and are able to use them to exploit their opponents in a similar fashion to their other Outlaw siblings.",
						"The Knifeslinger is the most specialized of the Outlaw focuses. They do one thing and they do it very well, sling knives. Be it at a range or up close, Knifeslingers are at their most natural with daggers in their hands. They are equally confident in throwing their daggers as they are in slashing with them. The motions and techniques of close-quarters, personal combat are second-nature to the Knifeslinger. Their familiarity with dynamics of combat allows them to react faster and grants them the ability to instill panic into their enemies."

You gain additional uses for Aces at 9th, 13th, and 17th level."
